### One Click Deploy

:::

You can easily deploy your own hosted version of the `JioSaavn API` by clicking on one of the links below, which will set up a ready-to-go version for you:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/sumitkolhe/jiosaavn-api)
[![Deploy with Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/rajput-hemant/jiosaavn-api-ts)
